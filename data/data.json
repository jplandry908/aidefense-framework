CFG is a core component that steers image generation towards a text prompt, but adversaries can exploit high guidance scale values to force the model to generate harmful, unsafe, or out-of-distribution content. These hardening techniques aim to control the CFG scale and its influence, preventing its misuse while preserving the model's creative capabilities. High CFG scales can overpower built-in safety conditioning and negative prompts, effectively steering the diffusion model toward disallowed or high-risk generations. This hardening treats CFG as a runtime safety-critical control surface, not just a creative knob, and enforces guardrails on how guidance is applied at inference time.",

The P-LLM can plan and request tool actions, but it must never see raw untrusted content; it only consumes Q-LLM's structured, validated outputs. This pattern reduces the impact of indirect prompt injection: even if untrusted content contains malicious instructions, they are confined to the Q-LLM, which has no tool privileges. <p>This privileged/quarantined separation pattern is formally described as the CaMeL (CApabilities for MachinE Learning) architecture by Google DeepMind, utilizing a dedicated coding/parsing model to isolate control flow from untrusted data.</p>",

This assumes the model or model runtime may already be tampered with or coerced (e.g. prompt-injected, modified weights, wrapped with hostile JS). The goal is not to \"fix\" the model but to strictly confine its blast radius using sandboxing, least capability, and controlled IPC.",

If these outputs are found externally (e.g., on the internet, in a competitor's product, in leaked documents), the watermark or beacon can help trace the output back to the originating AI system, potentially identifying model theft, misuse, or data leakage. Telemetry traps involve designing the AI to produce specific, unique (but benign) outputs for certain rare or crafted inputs, which, if observed externally, indicate that the model or its specific knowledge has been compromised or replicated. These watermarks and telemetry markers act as high-fidelity leak detectors: if they are observed outside trusted runtime or appear in external systems, that is treated as a security incident signal (possible model theft, supply chain compromise, or enterprise data exfiltration), not just IP branding.",
